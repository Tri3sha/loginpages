## Project Overview

The Android Login Page project is designed to showcase the implementation of a basic login page in an Android application. The login page allows users to enter their credentials and gain access to the application's main content. This project serves as a starting point for implementing user authentication and improving upon it according to specific project requirements.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for login interactions.
- Input fields for username/email and password.
- "Remember Me" functionality to store user credentials securely (optional).
- Validation checks for user inputs.
- Sample implementation of authentication logic (can be replaced with actual authentication mechanisms).
- Basic error handling and feedback to users.

## Requirements

- Android Studio (latest version recommended).
- Android SDK (version specified in the project).
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
